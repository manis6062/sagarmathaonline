' Derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm,

'
' ASP VBScript code for generating an MD5 'digest' or 'signature' of a string. The
' MD5 algorithm is one of the industry standard methods for generating digital
' signatures. It is generically known as a digest, digital signature, one-way
' encryption, hash or checksum algorithm. A common use for MD5 is for password
' encryption as it is one-way in nature, that does not mean that your passwords
' are not free from a dictionary attack.
